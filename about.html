  <h1>about</h1>

  <p>RDMT is a Filipino-American poet, visual artist, and DJ/producer with a strong interest in multi-instrumental creations. This passion arrived to him from a very early age when, fascinated by the soprano voice of an opera singer, he was inspired to play the violin.</p>

  <p>Today his productions reflect his tastes for fluctuating, acrobatic rhythms, deep distorted basses, and soaring melodies with visual creations and poetry. His poetry has been published in Paddler Press and Naugatuck River Review.</p>

  <p>Currently focused.</p>

  <p>He forms one-half of <a href="https://instagram.com/terper.club" target="_blank">→ Terper</a>.</p>
